# Vue Starter App 

To start, clone this repository with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/carolinechoi/vue-starter
```

Then, because the <em>node_modules</em> are included in my <em>.gitignore</em>, run the following to install all required packages:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Finally, if you make any changes in the files in the <em>src</em> folder, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Note: you should be running the <em>dist/index.html</em> file to see your changes. DO NOT edit this file. This file will be updated everytime you run the command referenced above.
